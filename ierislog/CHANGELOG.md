# Changelog

This file is used to list all changes between the versions of the module.

## [Unreleased]
No changes are currently being worked on and unreleased.

## [2.0.0] - XXXX-XX-XX
A complete rewrite of the logging component. The new version is a lot more
flexible and allows for more customization. The new version is not backwards 
compatible with the old version.

It has been designed to be more compatible with the slf4j API, but still remains
a standalone utility.

## [1.0.0] - 2023-05-07
This is the first public release of the library. It is the accumulation of all
changes since the project was started in 2021. The project hasn't kept track of
changes until now, so this is the first changelog entry.

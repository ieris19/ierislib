# Changelog

This file is used to list all changes between the versions of the library.
Each module has their own changelog, and as such, this file will only refer to
project-wide changes, or indicate when a module has been updated.

## [Unreleased]
No changes are currently being worked on and unreleased.

## [2.0.0] - 2023-05-07
This is the first public release of the library. It is the accumulation of all
changes since the project was started in 2021. The project hasn't kept track of
changes until now, so this is the first changelog entry.

(oldest first). The order might be slightly off, as I am listing from memory,

# IerisLib

A home for all the code that I might want to reuse in future projects
Most of this code is made for fun and practice and most of it is not really ever
to be used as there are usually much better alternatives to my own packages, but
it's always good to have software do *EXACTLY* what you want it to do and *JUST*
how you want it to do.

It is also worth mentioning that most of this code has been written along my
journey through my software engineering degree, meaning that some of this code I
wrote when I barely knew anything at all, while other pieces of code could have
been written at different stages of my journey.

Overall, this repository should host many small pet projects in order for me to
be able to reuse or just as pure practice. Occasionally some might be built to
showcase specific skills or features.

For now, the list of projects is the following:

* Game Utility Library (games)
* Command Console Builder (console)
* Money Library (economy)
* Logging module (log)
* Basic Scoreboard (scoreboard)
* Property reader/writer (properties)

The library has plans for:

* JavaFX MVVM Framework (ui)
* Security Handler (security)
